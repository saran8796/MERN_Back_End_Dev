In programming, sync (synchronous) and async (asynchronous) refer to how operations are executed with respect to time and waiting.

Synchronous (Sync)
Operations happen one after another.

Each process waits for the previous one to finish before executing.

Example: Reading a file synchronously pauses the program until the read is complete.

Asynchronous (Async)
Operations happen independently, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for some operations to complete.

Useful for tasks that take time, like network requests, file I/O, or timers.
