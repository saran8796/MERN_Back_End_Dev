###### **What is ORM – Object Relational Model?**



ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a technique that connects your programming language (objects) with your database (tables) so you don’t have to write raw SQL queries all the time.



It’s like a translator between your code and your database.



**Basic Idea:**



* In your code, you work with objects (like User, Product, Order).
* In your database, data is stored in tables (like users, products, orders).



* ORM automatically maps (connects) these two worlds:



&nbsp;	An object ↔ a row in a table



&nbsp;	An object’s properties ↔ columns in that table



* So instead of writing SQL like:



&nbsp;	SELECT \* FROM users WHERE id = 1;



* You can write simple code like:



&nbsp;	const user = User.findByPk(1);
