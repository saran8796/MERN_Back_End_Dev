* It was handled by react using state, it was mostly used in form.
* In a controlled component react controls the form values through state using useState().
* The input values always linked to the component state.

###### 

###### **uncontrolled component:**

	

* Handled by DOM directly using ref()
* In a uncontrolled component the form datas handled by DOM, not by react.
* We can use a ref() to directly access the value from the element.





###### **normal input ="text"** 

* cannot wrap text to the next line it always text to the next line, it's always single line by default.
* so, to simulate auto next line behaviour to all the content editable <div> styled exactly like a input box.





Methods have to learn:



* **DEBOUNCING**
* **DIFFING**
* **DESTRUCTURING**
* **VIRTUAL DOM**
