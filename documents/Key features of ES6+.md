# **Key features of ES6+**





##### **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)**



* This major release introduced many of the features now considered fundamental to modern JavaScript.



* let and const: New keywords for declaring variables with block scope, which is a significant improvement over the function-scoped var keyword.



* Arrow functions: A shorter syntax for writing function expressions, which also provides lexical this binding.



* Template literals: Strings enclosed in backticks (`) that allow for embedded expressions (string interpolation) and multi-line strings.



* Classes: Provides a clearer, cleaner syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance, though it is still syntactical sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.



* Modules: Native support for import and export statements to organize and reuse code across different files.



* Promises: A new way to handle asynchronous operations, providing a cleaner alternative to nested callbacks.



* Destructuring: A syntax that makes it easy to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.



* Rest and Spread operators (...): Provides functionality for collecting multiple elements into an array (rest) or expanding an array or object into individual elements (spread).



* Default parameters: Allows a default value to be set for a function parameter if no value or undefined is passed.





##### **ES7 (ECMAScript 2016)**



* This was a smaller update that included a few notable additions.



* Array.prototype.includes(): A method to check if an array includes a certain value, which returns a boolean (true or false).



* Exponentiation operator (\*\*): A new mathematical operator for calculating the power of a number (e.g., 2 \*\* 3 returns 8).





##### **ES8 (ECMAScript 2017)**



* async and await: This powerful pair of keywords was introduced to make asynchronous, promise-based code much easier to write and read, as it allows you to write async code that looks synchronous.



* Object.entries(): A method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property \[key, value] pairs.



* Object.values(): A method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property values.



* String padding: Adds the padStart() and padEnd() methods for adding padding to strings.



##### 

##### **ES9 (ECMAScript 2018)**



* Promise.prototype.finally(): A method that executes a callback when a promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected).



* Asynchronous iteration: Support for for-await-of loops, allowing iteration over asynchronous data sources.



* Rest/spread properties for objects: Enabled the use of the rest and spread syntax with object literals.





##### **ES10 (ECMAScript 2019)**



* Array.prototype.flat() and flatMap(): Methods to flatten nested arrays.



* Object.fromEntries(): The reverse of Object.entries(), it transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.



* Optional catch binding: Allows you to omit the error argument in a catch block if it is not needed.





##### **ES2020 and beyond**



Since ES2015, major versions have been released annually, adding further improvements.



###### **ES2020**: Introduced the Nullish Coalescing Operator (??), Optional Chaining (?.), and BigInt.



###### **ES2021**: Added String.prototype.replaceAll() and Promise.any().



###### **ES2022**: Included top-level await and private class fields.



###### **ES2023**: Brought new methods to Array.prototype like toSorted() and toReversed().



###### **ES2024**: Introduced Object.groupBy(), Map.groupBy(), and Promise.withResolvers().
