###### **CORS:**



**app.use() ->** we can use this to pass path(optional), handlers, middleware,



**Routing:**



* It means deciding which code to run when the user visits the particular URL or end point(full route).
* In small app all routes are stay in server.js but in real projects there are many routes so we move routes in separate pages for keep code organized and reusable.





&nbsp;	**index.js**:

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	import express from "express";

&nbsp;	import dotenv from "dotenv";

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	dotenv.config()

&nbsp;	const app = express()

&nbsp;	app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes)

&nbsp;	const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	app.listen(PORT, ()=>{

&nbsp;		console.log(`server running http://localhost:${PORT}`);

&nbsp;	}



&nbsp;	**/routes/authRoutes.js:**



&nbsp;	import express from 'express';

&nbsp;	



**controller:** 



* It is a pure JS logic file, we can maintain our request and response from the website we can manage here, and we can collaborate with databases like (SQL , MongoDB)**,** every logic oriented codes are maintained here.



**JSON Parse using express:**



* app.use(express.json()) -> this line parsing the string to json object
